<h1>Yanp_XH - a CMSimple_XH Plugin</h1>
<img src="../yanp.png" class="plugin_icon">
<p>YANP is the acronym for <strong>y</strong>et <strong>a</strong>nother
<strong>n</strong>ews <strong>p</strong>lugin.
It facilitates semi-automatic handling of news of a CMSimple_XH website,
that could be shown as newsbox and made available as RSS feed.
Consider it an alternative to creating and maintaining newsboxes manually
or using a fully automated solution, such as
<a href="http://cmsimplewiki.com/doku.php/plugins/whatsnew">WhatsNew</a> or
<a href="http://cmsimplewiki.com/doku.php/plugins/rss_feed">RSS Feed</a>.
If you have further demands, consider using an advanced solution, such as
<a href="http://cmsimplewiki.com/doku.php/plugins/advanced_news">AdvancedNews</a> or
<a href="http://www.ge-webdesign.de/cmsimpleplugins/?Eigene_Plugins/realblog_XH">Realblog</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Please do read this documentation!
It's generally a good idea to read the documentation,
<em>before</em> you encounter any problems!</strong></p>

<h2><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<p>Yanp_XH is a plugin for CMSimple_XH.
It requires a UTF-8 encoded version.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="installation">Installation</a></h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins.
See the <a href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.com/wiki/doku.php/manuals:users_manual:plugins:installation">
CMSimple_XH wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Backup the data on your server.</strong></li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory yanp/ to your server into CMSimple_XH's plugins directory.</li>
<li>Set write permissions to the subdirectories config/, css/, languages/ and to the plugin's data folder.</li>
<li><strong>Switch to "Yanp" in the back-end to check if all requirements are fulfilled.</strong></li>
</ol>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="settings">Settings</a></h2>
<p>The plugin's configuration is done as with many other
CMSimple_XH plugins in the website's back-end.
Select "Yanp" from "Plugins".</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Yanp_XH in "Plugin Config".
Hints for the options will be displayed
when hovering over the help icon with your mouse.</p>
<p>Localization is done in "Plugin Language".
You can translate the character strings to your own language,
or customize them according to your needs.
Particularly have a look at the entries in the "feed" and "news" group.</p>
<p>The look of Yanp_XH can be customized in "Plugin Stylesheet",
or alternatively in your template's stylesheet,
as the newsbox and the feed link are tied to that very closely.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
<p>Yanp_XH's news are related to CMSimple pages.
Each page could have an entry in the news.
To control this, just switch to the tab "News" above the editor.
If you enter any text as description, the page will be added to the news.
If you delete the description, the page will be removed from the news.
The timestamp of the news is used for ordering these (latest news will be on top).
The timestamp will be updated when you save the tab,
but it will not be more recent than the timestamp of the last edit of the according page.
So, if you've made a typo in the page and correct it later,
the timestamp of the news won't be affected.
OTOH, if you change the news later, the timestamp won't be affected,
as long as you don't save the page.</p>

<h3>Displaying the newsbox</h3>
<p>To display the newsbox you have to edit your template; replace the already existing
newsbox() call to:</p>
<pre>&lt;?php echo yanp_newsbox()?&gt;</pre>
<p>or insert it, perhaps in addition to already existing newsbox() calls.</p>
<p>Furthermore it's possible to display the newsbox on a CMSimple page
by inserting the plugin call:</p>
<pre>{{{PLUGIN:yanp_newsbox();}}}</pre>

<h3>Making available the RSS feed</h3>
<p>The RSS feed is made available to many modern browsers
automatically, because a &lt;link rel="alternate"&gt; tag is inserted
to the &lt;head&gt; of your website's pages by Yanp_XH.
To additionally display the RSS icon with a link to the RSS feed, you have to insert</p>
<pre>&lt;?php echo yanp_feedlink()?&gt;</pre>
<p>into your template. This basically works like mailformlink().
If you want to display another feed icon, just put it into your template's images/ folder,
and give it's filename as parameter:</p>
<pre>&lt;?php echo yanp_feedlink('filename.png')?&gt;</pre>
<p>Depending on your web server's configuration, the feed will be served as text/xml,
what may cause problems with the UTF-8 encoding.
So it should be served as application/rss+xml or application/xml.
For Apache servers the solution is to put an according .htaccess file into the plugin's data folder,
which is already done for the default data/ folder.
An alternative might be setting the "feed extension" to "rss".
But anyway, you should <a href="http://www.rssboard.org/rss-validator/">validate</a>
the RSS feed to be informed about possible problems.
