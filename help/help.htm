<h1>Yanp_XH &ndash; a CMSimple_XH Plugin</h1>
<img src="../yanp.png" class="plugin_icon" alt="Newspaper">
<p>YANP is the acronym for <strong>y</strong>et <strong>a</strong>nother
<strong>n</strong>ews <strong>p</strong>lugin. It facilitates semi-automatic
handling of news of a CMSimple_XH website, that could be shown as newsbox and
made available as RSS feed. Consider it an alternative to creating and
maintaining newsboxes manually or using a fully automated solution, such as <a
href="http://cmsimplewiki.com/doku.php/plugins/whatsnew">WhatsNew</a> or <a
href="http://cmsimplewiki.com/doku.php/plugins/rss_feed">RSS Feed</a>. If you
have further demands, consider using an advanced solution, such as <a
href="http://cmsimplewiki.com/doku.php/plugins/news">News</a> or <a
href="http://3-magi.net/?CMSimple_XH/Realblog_XH">Realblog_XH</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Please do read this manual <em>before</em> you encounter any
problems!</strong></p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Yanp_XH is a plugin for CMSimple_XH. It requires a UTF-8 encoded version.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins. See the <a
href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/installation"> CMSimple_XH
wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol>
<li>Backup the data on your server.</li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory yanp/ to your server into CMSimple_XH's plugins
directory.</li>
<li>Set write permissions to the subdirectories config/, css/, languages/ and to
the plugin's data folder.</li>
<li>Switch to "Yanp" in the back-end to check if all requirements are
fulfilled.</li>
</ol>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The plugin's configuration is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in
the website's back-end. Select "Plugins" &rarr; "Yanp".</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Yanp_XH under "Config". Hints for the
options will be displayed when hovering over the help icons with your mouse.</p>
<p>Localization is done under "Language". You can translate the character
strings to your own language (if there is no appropriate language file
available), or customize them according to your needs. Particularly have a look
at the entries in the "Feed" and "News" section.</p>
<p>The look of Yanp_XH can be customized under "Stylesheet", or alternatively in
your template's stylesheet, as the newsbox and the feed link are tied to that
very closely.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Yanp_XH's news are related to CMSimple pages. Each page can have an entry in
the news. To control this, just switch to the tab "News" above the editor. If
you enter any text as description, the page will be added to the news. If you
delete the description, the page will be removed from the news. The timestamp of
the news is used for ordering these (latest news will be on top). The timestamp
will be updated when you save the tab, but it will not be more recent than the
timestamp of the last edit of the according page. So, if you've made a typo in
the page and correct it later, the timestamp of the news won't be affected. On
the other hand, if you change the news later, the timestamp won't be affected,
as long as you don't save the page.</p>

<h3>Displaying the newsbox</h3>
<p>To display the newsbox you have to edit your template; replace an already
existing newsbox() call with:</p>
<pre>&lt;?php echo yanp_newsbox()?&gt;</pre>
<p>or insert it, perhaps in addition to already existing newsbox() calls.</p>
<p>Furthermore it's possible to display the newsbox on a CMSimple page by
inserting the plugin call:</p>
<pre>{{{PLUGIN:yanp_newsbox();}}}</pre>

<h3>Making the RSS feed available</h3>
<p>The RSS feed is made available to many modern browsers automatically, because
a &lt;link rel="alternate"&gt; tag is inserted to the &lt;head&gt; of your
website's pages by Yanp_XH. To additionally display the RSS icon with a link to
the RSS feed, you have to insert</p>
<pre>&lt;?php echo yanp_feedlink()?&gt;</pre>
<p>into your template. This basically works like mailformlink(). If you want to
display another feed icon, just put it into your template's images/ folder, and
give it's filename as parameter:</p>
<pre>&lt;?php echo yanp_feedlink('filename.png')?&gt;</pre>
<p>Depending on your web server's configuration, the feed will be served as
text/xml, what may cause problems with the UTF-8 encoding. So it should be
served as application/rss+xml or application/xml. For Apache servers the
solution is to put an according .htaccess file into the plugin's data folder,
which is already done for the default data/ folder. An alternative might be
setting the "feed extension" to "rss". But anyway, you should <a
href="http://www.rssboard.org/rss-validator/">validate</a> the RSS feed to be
informed about possible problems.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Under CMSimple_XH 1.6 - 1.6.2 when saving the News tab there is the
spurious error message "Could not save content file". This is caused by a bug in
CMSimple_XH and will be fixed with CMSimple_XH 1.6.3.</p>
