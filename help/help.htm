<h1 id="yanp_xh">Yanp_XH</h1>
<p>YANP is the acronym for Yet Another News Plugin. It facilitates semi-automatic handling of the news of a CMSimple_XH website, that could be shown as newsbox and made available as RSS feed. Consider it an alternative to creating and maintaining newsboxes manually or using a fully automated solution, such as WhatsNew or RSS Feed. If you have further demands, consider using an advanced solution, such as <a href="https://davidstutz.de/projects/cmsimple-plugins/?News#news">News</a> or <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/realblog_xh">Realblog_XH</a>.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Yanp_XH is a plugin for CMSimple_XH ≥ 1.7.0. It requires PHP ≥ 5.6.0.</p>
<h2 id="download">Download</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/yanp_xh/releases/latest">lastest release</a> is available for download on Github.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins. See the <a href="https://wiki.cmsimple-xh.org/doku.php/installation">CMSimple_XH wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Backup the data on your server.</li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory <code>yanp/</code> to your server into the <code>plugins/</code> directory of CMSimple_XH.</li>
<li>Set write permissions for the subdirectories <code>config/</code>, <code>css/</code> and <code>languages/</code>.</li>
<li>Navigate to <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Yanp</code> in the back-end to check if all requirements are fulfilled.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The configuration of the plugin is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in the back-end of the website. Select <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Yanp</code>.</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Yanp_XH under <code>Config</code>. Hints for the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon with your mouse.</p>
<p>Localization is done under <code>Language</code>. You can translate the character strings to your own language if there is no appropriate language file available, or customize them according to your needs. Particularly have a look at the entries in the <code>Feed</code> and <code>News</code> sections. The possible format characters for <code>News</code> → <code>Date Format</code> are described in the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php">PHP manual</a>.</p>
<p>The look of Yanp_XH can be customized under <code>Stylesheet</code>, or alternatively in the stylesheet of your template, as the newsbox and the feed link are tied to that very closely.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>The news of Yanp_XH are related to CMSimple_XH pages. Each page can have an entry in the news. To control this, just switch to the tab <code>News</code> above the editor. If you enter any text as description, the page will be added to the news. If you delete the description, the page will be removed from the news. The timestamp of the news is used for ordering these (latest news will be on top). The timestamp will be updated when you save the tab, but it will not be more recent than the timestamp of the last edit of the according page. So, if you have made a typo in the page and correct it later, the timestamp of the news will not be affected. On the other hand, if you change the news later, the timestamp will not be affected, as long as you do not save the page.</p>
<h3 id="displaying-the-newsbox">Displaying the newsbox</h3>
<p>To display the newsbox you have to edit your template; replace an already existing <code>newsbox()</code> call with:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?=Yanp_newsbox()?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>or insert it, perhaps in addition to already existing <code>newsbox()</code> calls.</p>
<p>Furthermore it is possible to display the newsbox on a CMSimple_XH page by inserting the plugin call:</p>
<pre><code>{{{Yanp_newsbox()}}}</code></pre>
<h3 id="making-the-rss-feed-available">Making the RSS feed available</h3>
<p>Browsers <em>may</em> report that an RSS feed is available, because a <code>&lt;link rel="alternate"&gt;</code> tag is inserted into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the pages of your Website by Yanp_XH. To additionally display the RSS icon with a link to the RSS feed, you have to insert the following into your template:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?=Yanp_feedlink()?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This basically works like <code>mailformlink()</code>. If you want to display another feed icon, just put it into the <code>images/</code> folder of your template, and give its filename as parameter:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?=Yanp_feedlink(&#39;filename.svg&#39;)?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>In any case, you should <a href="https://www.rssboard.org/rss-validator/">validate</a> the RSS feed to be informed about possible problems.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>When the website can be requested with www and without it (e.g. <code>www.example.com</code> and <code>example.com</code>) without redirecting one to the other, the RSS feed may not link correctly back to itself. It is generally recommended that you establish a 301 redirect from <code>www.example.com</code> to <code>example.com</code> or vice versa.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Report bugs and ask for support either on <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/yanp_xh/issues">Github</a> or in the <a href="https://cmsimpleforum.com/">CMSimple_XH Forum</a>.</p>
